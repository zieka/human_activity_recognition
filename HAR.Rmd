# Introduction

# Preparing the Data
### Required Packag(s):
```{r warning=FALSE}
library(caret)
````

## Loading the Data

```{r}
training.raw <- read.csv("./data/pml-training.csv")
testing.raw <- read.csv("./data/pml-testing.csv")
```

```{r}
colnames(training.raw)
```

## Cleaning the Data

First 7 columns do not provide kinametic data so we can remove them as they will not be very good predictors:

```{r}
training.clean <- subset( training.raw, select = -c(1:7) )
testing.clean <- subset ( testing.raw, select = -c(1:7) )
```

## Splitting the Data


# Building a Predictive Model

## Machine Learning

## Cross validating the model

# Testing the Final Model

## Appling the model to a test set

### Properly formating the results for submission

### Results
