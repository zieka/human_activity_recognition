# Human Activity Recognition
---------------

Using the Human Activity Recognition dataset (http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) this project reports on the following:

* Resampling the set into a testing set and training set
* Using  machine learning to produce a predictive model
* Cross validating the model on the training set 
* Appling the model to a validation set to predict human activity based on kinematic data
* Properly formating the results for individual submission
